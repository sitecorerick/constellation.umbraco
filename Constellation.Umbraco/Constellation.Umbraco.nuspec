	<summary>A library for Controller-based Umbraco installations.</summary>
	<description>
		This library introduces ease of use for handmade ViewModels that represent IPublishedContent items. The ViewModels should inherit from Models.ContetnViewModel in order to take advantage of the
		automatic property mapping provided by this library.

		To Use:
			1. Create ViewModels that represent content. ViewModel properties should match types and names of the published content Properties[] collection.
			2. Each ViewModel should have a ContentType attribute on the class that specifies the Alias for the content that it represents.
			3. To convert a PublishedContent to a ViewModel, use the extension methods provided in this library. You may automatically cast to the "best fit" type, or you may cast to a specific ViewModel type.

		This library was ported from concepts in Constellation.Sitecore.Items - it is not a 1:1 match, expect evolution.
